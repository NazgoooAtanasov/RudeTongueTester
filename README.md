# RudeTongueTester

##### Title: "RudeTongueTester"
---
### **RudeTongueTester** is an application built with ML.NET for recognizing "rude" words or an entire sentence.
---

### **Usage:**

It is pretty straight forward. For example when a word or an entire sentece is given to the command line the AI tries to predict whether the word (sentence) is "rude".

---
### **Example:**
On the left side is the word that gets inputed to the command line and to the right side is the result that the AI got.

    bad => 1 
    better => 0
The 1 represents the value of true and 0 the value of false.
When the result is *true* it means that the given word (sentence) is "rude". 
When the result is *false* it means the given word (sentence) is not "rude".
